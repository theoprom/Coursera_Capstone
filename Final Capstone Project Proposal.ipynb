            "source": "Berlin is one of the most populous cities in the European Union with an estimated population of 3.6 million in 2021. The city's rich history of immigrants and its inclusive attitude towards diverse identities have made the city an international destination for highly-skilled, young talents. Besides its cultural assets and lively social scenes, Berlin also boasts a number of world-renowned universities and research institutions recognized by the Times Higher Education such as the Free University of Berlin and the Humboldt University of Berlin. Furthermore, Berlin offers a great selection of post-graduation opportunities in its start-up world or in one of its fast-growing service, creative, and high-tech industries.\n\nThis project aims to respond to Berlin's ability to attract both domestic and international students by tackling one of the biggest concerns facing this demographic: relocating to and settling in a new city. Thus, the problem statement can be phrased as the following questions:\n\n> Which neighborhoods in Berlin are most appealing to university students? How can we characterize the experiences of living in one of these neighborhoods?\n\nAlthough several subjective factors will contribute to such a decision, this project will examine quantifiable factors such as average rent prices, demography, and average commute distances to surrounding universities. In addition, venues surrounding public transport stations will be used to create different clusters. These clusters will help describe the amenities available in each neighborhood and further tailor the project's recommendations to the unique needs of each student. \n"

Additional information can be webscraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_and_neighborhoods_of_Berlin)\n* **A CSV file with a list of [universities in Berlin](https://www.hochschulkompass.de/home.html) (Hochschulen and Universit\u00e4ten).** Coordinates were manually coded using Google Maps.\n* **[Public transport stations](https://github.com/okfde/berlin.appsandthecity/tree/gh-pages/downloads) used for clustering**. The raw Excel file was cleaned by referencing Wikipedia to include only [U-Bahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Berlin_U-Bahn_stations) and [S-Bahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Berlin_S-Bahn_stations) stations. Coordinates were then converted from Gau\u00df-Kr\u00fcger Zone 4 to WGS84 Decimal Degrees. Rather than using localities, clustering these stations will provide more variation in the results. Furthermore, students who relocated to an urban area are unlikely to own a car, making access to public transportation essential.\n* **Rent prices by localities webscraped from [HomeDay](https://www.homeday.de/de/blog/mietpreise-berlin-2019/).** Data as of 2019.\n* **A [CSV file](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/einwohnerinnen-und-einwohner-den-ortsteilen-berlins-am-31122019) containing demographics by localities.** Data as of December 31st, 2019. The raw CSV file was cleaned by referencing the accompanying metadata.\n* **Foursquare Venue Data obtained using its API.** In order to segment the public transport stations into clusters, venues within a 700 meters search radius of each station were collected. For this project, neighborhoods are defined by the walking catchment around these stations. 700 meters was selected based on the [average walking distance of Berliners](https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index-countries), and this distance is unlikely to result in signficiant overlapping judging from the [average walking distance between stations](https://medium.com/@kristin_baumann/walking-the-berlin-s-u-bahn-network-ec2c0b2642fd). Foursquare [metadata](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/build-with-foursquare/categories/) was also downloaded to group venue categories during data processing.\n\n"
