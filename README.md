# A Data-Driven Guide to Berlin's Neighborhoods for University Students

## This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, raw data, and other deliverables associated with the IBM Data Science Applied Capstone course. 

This project aims to determine the best areas in Berlin for university students to relocate to. Neighborhoods are defined as walking catchments around public transport stations (U- and S-Bahn Stations). Furthermore, these neighborhoods are part of selected localities (Ortsteile) in Berlin that meet other critieria such as affordable rent prices and a reasonable commute time to universities. Neighborhoods are also clustered based on venue data obtained from Foursquare to characterize the experiences that each neighborhood will provide.

References and data sources can be found within the notebooks and deliverables.
